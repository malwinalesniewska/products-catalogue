# ProductsCatalogue

IMPORTANT: as json-server doesn't allow access to nested objects in database, editing price overwrite all price objects in prices array.
To run both server and app, use npm run api:serve in products-catalogue folder.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.
Backend mocked with json-server.
Simple app to show list of products.
